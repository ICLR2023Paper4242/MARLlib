<h1 align="center"> MARLlib: The MARL Extension for RLlib </h1>

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]()

**Multi-Agent RLlib (MARLlib)** is ***a comprehensive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm library*** based on [**Ray**](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and one of its toolkits [**RLlib**](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib). It provides MARL research community with a unified platform for building, training, and evaluating MARL algorithms.

There are five core features of **MARLlib**.

- It unifies multi-agent environment interfaces with a new interface following Gym standard and supports both synchronous and asynchronous agent-environment interaction. Currently, MARLlib provides support to ten environments.
- It unifies diverse algorithm pipeline with a newly proposed single-agent perspective of implementation. Currently, MARLlib incorporates 18 algorithms and is able to handle cooperative (team-reward-only cooperation), collaborative (individual-reward-accessible cooperation), competitive (individual competition), and mixed (teamwork-based competition) tasks.
- It classifies algorithms into independent learning, centralized critic, and value decomposition categories(inspired by EPyMARL) and enables module reuse and extensibility within each category.
- It provides three parameter sharing strategies, namely full-sharing, non-sharing, and group-sharing, by implementing the policy mapping API of RLlib. This is implemented to be fully decoupled from algorithms and environments, and is completely controlled by configuration files.
- It provides standard 2 or 20 millions timesteps learning curve in the form of CSV of each task-algorithm for reference. These results are reproducible as configuration files for each experiment are provided along.

## Overview

### Environments

Most of the popular environments in MARL research are supported by MARLlib:

## Installation

Install Ray 
```
pip install ray==1.8.0 # version sensitive
```


Add patch of MARLlib
```
cd /Path/To/MARLlib/patch
python add_patch.py -y
```

**Y** to replace source-packages code

**Attention**: Above is the common installation. Each environment needs extra dependency. Please read the installation instruction in envs/base_env/install.



## Usage

### Step 1. Prepare the configuration files

<div align="center">
<img src=image/configurations.png width=100% />
</div>

There are four configuration files you need to ensure correctness for your training demand. 

- scenario: specify your environment/task settings
- algorithm: finetune your algorithm hyperparameters
- model: customize the model architecture
- ray/rllib: changing the basic training settings

### Step 2. Making sure all the dependency are installed for your environment.

You can refer to [here](https://iclr2023-marllib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/env.html) to install the environment.
After everything settled, make sure to change back you Gym version to 1.21.0.
All environment MARLlib supported should work fine with this version.

```
pip install gym==1.21.0
```

### Step 3. Start training
```
cd /Path/To/MARLlib
python marl/main.py --algo_config=MAPPO [--finetuned] --env_config=smac with env_args.map_name=3m
```
--finetuned is optional, force using the finetuned hyperparameter if available.

## Experiment Results



## Contribute

MARLlib is friendly to incorporating a new environment. Besides the ten we already implemented, we support almost all kinds of MARL environments.
Before contributing new environment, you must know:

Things you ought to cover:

- provide a new environment interface python file, follow the style of [MARLlib/envs/base_env](https://github.com/ICLR2023Paper4242/MARLlib/tree/main/envs/base_env)
- provide a corresponding config yaml file, follow the style of [MARLlib/envs/base_env/config](https://github.com/ICLR2023Paper4242/MARLlib/tree/main/envs/base_env/config)
- provide a corresponding instruction readme file, follow the style of [MARLlib/envs/base_env/install](https://github.com/ICLR2023Paper4242/MARLlib/tree/main/envs/base_env/install)

Things not essential:

- change the MARLlib data processing pipeline
- provide a unique runner or controller specific to the environment 
- concern about the data logging 

The ten environments we already contained have covered great diversity in action space,  observation space, agent-env interaction style, task mode, additional information like action mask, etc. 
The best practice to incorporate your environment is to find an existing similar one and provide the same interface.

## Bug Shooting

Our patch files fix most RLlib-related errors on MARL.

Here we only list the common bugs, not RLlib-related. (Mostly is your mistake)

- *observation/action out of space* bug:
    - make sure the observation/action space defined in env init function 
        - has same data type with env returned data (e.g., float32/64)
        - env returned data range is in the space scope (e.g., box(-2,2))
    - the returned env observation contained the required key (e.g., action_mask/state)
    
- *Action NaN is invaild* bug
    - this is common bug in continuous control problem, carefully finetune the algorithm's hyperparameter
        - smaller learning rate
        - set some action value bound
